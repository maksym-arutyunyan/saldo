# Saldo

Saldo is a lightweight, cross-platform expense tracker. This repository contains the initial scaffolding for a Svelte + TypeScript application with Tauri integration.

This project avoids committing binary assets. The favicon is embedded inline as an SVG data URI.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:web
```

For a Tauri desktop build:

```bash
npm run dev:desktop
```

## Production Builds

To create a web build:

```bash
npm run build:web
```

To build the desktop app:

```bash
npm run build:desktop
```
