> DONE when all TODOs in this section are replaced with real project-specific content.

This document defines the intended behavior, design boundaries, and guiding principles of **Saldo**.

## Goal

- Saldo is a lightweight, cross-platform expense tracker.
- Maintain minimal dependencies and a clear command-line interface.

## Core Behavior

- TODO 2: List the key behaviors or commands the tool supports.
- For example: "Sorts derive attributes in Rust source files", "Fails with exit code 1 if unsorted", etc.

## Out of Scope

- TODO 3: List things the tool does *not* try to solve.
- For example: "Does not parse full syntax trees", "Does not integrate with IDEs out of the box".
